# Movie Genre Website

This is a simple movie website that displays movies from various genres like Bollywood, Tollywood, Lollywood, and Animated movies. The user can navigate through different movie genres by clicking on the corresponding buttons. When a user clicks on a genre, the page will display a list of movies associated with that genre.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: 
  - Bollywood
  - Lollywood
  - Animated Movies
  
- Each button is clickable and will display a list of movies specific to the selected genre.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The website is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the website.
- **CSS**: To style the website and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To make the buttons functional and display movies when a button is clicked.

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-genre-website.git



### Explanation of the Button:
- I used an image shield (`![View Page](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20Page-Click%20Here-brightgreen)`) to create a "button-like" link in Markdown.
- When the user clicks on this shield-style link, it will open the [Vercel page](https://photo-gallery-brown-five.vercel.app/).
